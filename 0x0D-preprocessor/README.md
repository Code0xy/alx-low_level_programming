I am working on C preprocessor
- A header file that defines a macro named SIZE
- A header file that defines a macro named pI
- A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from
- A function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x
- A function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
